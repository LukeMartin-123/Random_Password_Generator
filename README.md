# Random_Password_Generator

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a random password generator. We were given starter HTML and css files but had to complete the Javascript code in order to get everything working. The page loads and the application starts when the user clicks the "Generate Password" button. Then the user is asked how long you would like your password to be and the app requires it to be between 8 and 128 characters. If the user enters a value that is not between 8 and 128 they will receive an error message.

From there the user is asked a series of questions about what they want their password to include. The options include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters:

 After the user confirms all their choices for characters, the program runs and generates a completely random password:
